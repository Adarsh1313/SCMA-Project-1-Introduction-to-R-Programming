#### Creating a Vector #### 

# Statement
#A class of 10 students have been surveyed and their heights recorded:
# 150cm, 150cm, 142cm, 154cm, 168cm, 153cm, 151cm, 153cm, 142cm and 151cm

#creating a variable called height
height = c(150,150,142,154,168,153,151,153,142,151)

#To know the class of variable
class(height)

#To know the length of variable
length(height)

#lets create two more variables colour and logical values
colour = c('red','green','blue','blue','red','green','red','green','blue', 'red')

#To know the length of variable
length(colour)

#To know the class of variable
class(colour)

#creating a variable survey
survey = c(TRUE, FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)

#To know the class of variable
class(survey)

#To know the length of variable
length(height)

#### To recall a single value from the vector, use the variable name #### 
#followed by the position of the value in the 
#list and surrounded by [ ] brackets.


#To access value by position in the variable
height[5]

#To last access last value
height[length(height)]

#To access a range of value
height[3:7]

#To access a range of value
colour[3:5]

# To call the first value in the vector
height[1]
head(height,5)
height[1:5]

#To call the last value in the vector
height[length(height)] # len(height) = 10
tail(height,1)

# To request all values between the 3rd and 7th place in the vector
height[3:7]


# Useful statistical analysis can be performed on single set of values using vectors
summary(height)
summary(colour)
summary(survey)


# Combining Vectors into a Dataframe
# A dataset will often contain more than 1 variable of interest. 
#To combine vectors of the same length together into a table or “dataframe” 
#(similar to an excel table), we use the data.frame() command.

df = data.frame(colour,height,survey)
#removing varibale out of the environment
rm(table)

# To retrieve a single value from a data frame assigned to a variable, the variable name is used
#then followed by the coordinates of the value within [row, column] square brackets (eg.table[2,1])
df[5,2]
View(df)
fix(df)

# Data types
# Every piece of data in R is stored as either double, integer,logical or character.

# 1. integer variables can only store whole numbers
# 2. double variables can store floating point numbers (i.e. with a decimal part)
# 3. logical variables can store TRUE or FALSE
# 4. character variables can store strings of characters.


# You can find out what type of data is stored within a variable or a column in adata
#frame using the class () function.
